      Note the usage of %PUBLIC_URL% in the references above.
      These placeholders will be replaced with the actual public folder path during the build process.
      Files referenced using %PUBLIC_URL% must reside in the `public` directory.

      This ensures compatibility with both client-side routing and apps hosted under non-root URLs.
      For non-root URLs, refer to the build instructions via `npm run build`.

      This file serves as the HTML template for the app.
      Opening it directly in a browser will render a blank page, as the content

      Use `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the development server.
      To generate a production build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
